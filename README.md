# Karpenter

Karpenter improves the efficiency and cost of running workloads on Kubernetes clusters by:

* **Watching** for pods that the Kubernetes scheduler has marked as unschedulable
* **Evaluating** scheduling constraints (resource requests, nodeselectors, affinities, tolerations, and topology spread constraints) requested by the pods
* **Provisioning** nodes that meet the requirements of the pods
* **Removing** the nodes when the nodes are no longer needed

## Karpenter Implementations
Karpenter is a multi-cloud project with implementations by the following cloud providers:
- [AWS](https://github.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws)
- [Azure](https://github.com/Azure/karpenter-provider-azure)
